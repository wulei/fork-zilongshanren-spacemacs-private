* My personal Emacs configuration
Hacking journey begins start from 2013.

** What's the highlight of this configuration
1. It's a highly optimized Spacemacs configuration, you should use the configuration together with the develop branch of the officially Spacemacs.
2. I prefer to the =Ivy= completion interface, so I removed many helm related packages but keep the =helm-ag= package. The =counsel-ag= counterpart is not powerful as =helm-ag=.
3. I also removed some packages I don't have any chance to use. The complete list lies in the exclude section of the =init.el= file.
4. I also exclude the =Spaceline= package, cause it's easy to frozen the Emacs with this package enabled. So I create my own mode line configuration based on =Spaceline=.
5. The =Swiper= package sometimes frozen the Emacs UI when you split the window with very long lines. You could use `pkill -SIGUSR2 -i emacs` command line to break the frozen.
